# Project I: Building a simple software defined network (SDN)

## To submit:
 Create a tag named "submission" when you are ready to submit. You can use the following command or the github interface to do so.
> git tag -a submission -m "optional message"

This will show you if the tag is created:
> git tag

If you first create your git tag locally, make sure to also push the tag to your remote github repo. Our grader does not have access to your local git repository.
**Do not submit any binaries. Your git repo should only contain source files; no products of compilation.**

**Once you submit your grade will be given in "grade.txt" file in the branch 'grade'. It might take a few minutes for the branch to show up.**
